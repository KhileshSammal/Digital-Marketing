                    <p>This document, referred to as the “Terms of Service” or “Agreement,” governs the relationship between the User (also referred to as the “Client”) and the Freelancer (also referred to as the “Service Provider”) regarding the use of the PPC Campaign Audit Service (the “Service”). By availing of the Service, the User agrees to abide by the terms outlined in this document.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Service Description</h2>
                    <p>The Service involves a comprehensive audit of the User’s pay-per-click (PPC) marketing campaigns. This may include, but is not limited to, an examination of keywords, ad copy, targeting settings, landing page performance, conversion metrics, and overall campaign strategy. A report detailing findings and recommendations will be provided to the User.</p>
                    <p>If specified, the Service may include a period of account management, ranging from 2 weeks to 1 month. Upon completion of this management period, the Client has the option to continue account management on a rolling monthly contract basis.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Payment and Fees</h2>
                    <p>The User agrees to pay the Service Provider according to the fee structure agreed upon before the commencement of the Service. Full payment is due prior to the delivery of the Service, and no work will begin until payment is received in full. All charges and prices for services rendered are subject to VAT at the standard rate. All estimated prices quoted—whether in writing or verbally—apply solely to the listed services. Any additional services required will be quoted and charged separately.</p>
                    <p>Invoices are issued either monthly, upon project completion, or following the advance booking of a consultancy call at a pre-agreed rate. If there is a change in the brief, the Service Provider will inform the Client of any additional charges likely to be incurred.</p>
                    <p>All projects are scheduled based on mutual agreement. Failure by the Client to adhere to agreed timelines may result in missed deadlines or additional fees. For new clients, full or partial payment (plus VAT) may be required in advance, as agreed between parties. All subsequent invoices must be paid upon receipt. Once a Client agrees to the Service Provider’s Terms of Service, Knowledgeful Limited will invoice the project in accordance with the agreed timescale.</p>
                    <p>All creative work produced during a project remains the property of the Service Provider until full payment is received. The Service reserves the right to subcontract or outsource work if it is in the best interest of the Client. Any outsourced work remains under the ownership and responsibility of the Service Provider.</p>
                    <p>If the Client wishes to cancel during the design or development cycle, they may do so but will be invoiced proportionally based on work completed. Knowledgeful Limited retains a lien on all products, data, and materials until all outstanding payments have been cleared. This includes the right to withhold or recall services, including web hosting, if payments remain unpaid for more than one month from the invoice date.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Confidentiality</h2>
                    <p>The Service Provider will treat all information related to the Service as strictly confidential and will not disclose any such information without the User’s written consent, unless required by law. The Service reserves the right to include a credit on printed or digital media unless instructed otherwise by the Client.</p>
                    <p>The Service also reserves the right to use both initial creative concepts and final approved design work for marketing purposes, unless otherwise requested in writing by the Client.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Limitation of Liability</h2>
                    <p>The Service Provider shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including, but not limited to, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from the Service. No guarantees are made regarding improvements in PPC campaign performance or conversions.</p>
                    <p>It is the Client’s responsibility to ensure that all materials supplied to the Service Provider (e.g., images, videos, data, intellectual property) are properly licensed. Knowledgeful Limited will not be held liable for any copyright infringements arising from client-supplied content. For projects involving third parties commissioned by the Client, the Service Provider shall not be held responsible for the non-completion of those third-party services.</p>
                    <p>In the event of a dispute (excluding non-payment), both parties agree to attempt resolution in good faith. The Client must notify the Service Provider immediately of any issue that may lead to a dispute. Without timely notification, the Service Provider will not be held liable.</p>
                    <p>While every effort is made to protect all media and correspondence, the Service Provider shall not be held financially responsible for any losses. The Service cannot guarantee exclusivity of any marketing concept or design. The Client is responsible for seeking copyright protection for any creative or intellectual property if desired.</p>
                    <p>The Service Provider shall not be liable for failure to deliver the Service due to events beyond its control, including but not limited to: Acts of God, terrorism, war, fire, flood, power failure, or legal restrictions. In such cases, the Client may elect to terminate the contract by written notice and pay for work completed to date.</p>
